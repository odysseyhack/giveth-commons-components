 A Practical Model for accessing mainainability - paper SIG

Building Maintainable Software - O'Reilly Book

Write small units

Limit parameters to 4
Aim for low cyclomatic complexity
Write unit tests (I Think we just need to have some on key components) Actually chcek ratio of tests to production code. 


**GitHub repos on get automatically tested by Better Code Hub to output a score**
Tool gives repo a score out of 10 and identifies areas for improvement
If have multiple repos (like we are going to) take the lowest scoring repo from team


NOT THAT HARD TO GET A 10 IF YOU TAKE CARE OF QUALITY FROM THE START

Can apply for a jedi 10 minute grilling from SIG. Limited spaces so apply early. Unlock Mature Prototype Status.
Spots only for teams with 10/10
Times from 
Saturday 20.00 - 22.00
